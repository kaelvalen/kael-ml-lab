    "## Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get anything done, we need some way to store and manipulate data. Generally,there are two important things we need to do with data: (i) acquire them; and (ii) processthem once they are inside the computer. There is no point in acquiring data without someway to store it, so to start, let’s get our hands dirty with𝑛-dimensional arrays, which wealso calltensors. If you already know the NumPy scientific computing package, this will bea breeze. For all modern deep learning frameworks, thetensor class(ndarrayin MXNet,Tensorin PyTorch and TensorFlow) resembles NumPy’sndarray, with a few killer fea-tures added. First, the tensor class supports automatic differentiation. Second, it leveragesGPUs to accelerate numerical computation, whereas NumPy only runs on CPUs. Theseproperties make neural networks both easy to code and fast to run.\n",
