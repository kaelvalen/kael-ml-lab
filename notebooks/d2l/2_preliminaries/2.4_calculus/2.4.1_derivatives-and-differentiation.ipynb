        "# Derivatives\n",
        "\n",
        "## Definition\n",
        "Put simply, a derivative is the rate of change in a function with respect to changes in its arguments. Derivatives can tell us how rapidly a loss function would increase or decrease were we to increase or decrease each parameter by an infinitesimally small amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Formal Definition\n",
        "Formally, for functions f: ℝ → ℝ, that map from scalars to scalars, the derivative of f at a point x is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x + h) - f(x)] $/$ h\n",
        "\n",
        "This term on the right hand side is called a limit and it tells us what happens to the value of an expression as a specified variable approaches a particular value. This limit tells us what the ratio between a perturbation h and the change in the function value f(x + h) - f(x) converges to as we shrink its size to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Differentiability\n",
        "When f'(x) exists, f is said to be differentiable at x; and when f'(x) exists for all x on a set, e.g., the interval [a, b], we say that f is differentiable on this set. Not all functions are differentiable, including many that we wish to optimize, such as accuracy and the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUC). However, because computing the derivative of the loss is a crucial step in nearly all algorithms for training deep neural networks, we often optimize a differentiable surrogate instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Interpretation\n",
        "We can interpret the derivative f'(x) as the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) with respect to x. Let's develop some intuition with an example. Define u = f(x) = 3x² - 4x."
