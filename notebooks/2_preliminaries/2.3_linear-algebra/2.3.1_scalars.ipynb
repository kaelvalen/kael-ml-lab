        "In everyday mathematics, we often work with single values called **scalars**.  \n",
        "- Example: The temperature in Palo Alto is 72°F. To convert it to Celsius, we use the formula:  \n",
        "  $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, where $f = 72$.  \n",
        "  - Here, 5, 9, and 32 are constant scalars, while $c$ and $f$ are variables representing unknown scalars.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Notation\n",
        "- Scalars are denoted by lowercase letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, $z$).  \n",
        "- The space of all real-valued scalars is denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$.  \n",
        "  - For example, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ means $x$ is a real-valued scalar.  \n",
        "  - $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ means $x$ and $y$ can only take values 0 or 1.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Scalars as Tensors\n",
        "- Scalars are implemented as tensors containing a single element.  \n",
        "- We can perform basic operations like addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation on scalars."
