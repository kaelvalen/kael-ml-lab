        "- Tensors are generalizations of $n$th-order arrays and can have an arbitrary number of axes.  \n",

        "- Tensors are denoted by capital letters with a special font (e.g., $\\mathbf{X}$, $\\mathbf{Y}$, $\\mathbf{Z}$), and their elements are indexed similarly to matrices (e.g., $x_{ijk}$ or $\\mathbf{X}_{1,2,i_1,3}$).  \n",
